    This directory has the scripts to set up multimodal network 
    data for NDM analysis.

    (1) setup.sql     : Creates a user for the basic network 
                        (currently road network) data.
                        Current script creates a user called navteq_dc
                    
    **** Make sure that the dmp file for the network is present in the directory.***

    (2) demo.sql      : This sets up the required multimodal data for ndmdemo.
                        The script assumes that the multimodal transit data is 
                        available in General Transit Feed Specification 
                        (GTFS) format and stored in files in csv format.
                
    **** Before running this script, make sure that 
         (a) The basic network (NAVTEQ_DC) is loaded.
         (b) Directory called WORK_DIR is created and the user has read/write 
             permissions on it.
         (c) WORK_DIR has the csv files for transit data in GTFS format.
         (d) mm_util.sql is present in teh current directory.
         (e) The jar file multimodalndm.jar is available in the directory.
             The jar file can generated by running make in 
             sdo/demo/network/ndmdemo directory and the jar file will 
             be available in
             sdo/demo/network/ndmdemo/ship/web/WEB_INF/lib directory.

     (3) mm_util.sql   : Loads the mm_util package, which has the procedures 
                         used to generate multimodal data, in the required 
                         format.
