Setting up NDM Demo
-------------------
Setting up data
---------------
Data setup involves the creation of two users, the demo user (ndmdemo) 
and network user (navteq_sf).

(1)Creation and set up of ndmdemo user
--------------------------------------
Requirements:
-------------
	ndmdemo.sql 
         	SQL script that creates and sets up the user ndmdemo.
	ndmdemo_util.sql 
        	PL-SQL procedures to set up the network data. 
                These procedures are later used in setting up navteq_sf  
                network data for demo.
	traffic_util.sql
       		PL-SQL procedures to set up traffic related data. 
                These are used to create traffic pattern tables required 
                user data generation for navteq_sf network.
	ndmtraffic.jar
      		Jar file contains the java code for traffic user data generation.
	styles_themes_maps.dmp
        	This dmp file had the map viewer styles, themes, and maps 
		required for displaying  the base map and network analysis results.

ndmdemo.sql is the main script that sets up ndmdemo data. Make sure that 
the files specified above are under the same directory as this script 
and script is run from this directory.
ndmdemo.sql, ndmdemo_util.sql, traffic_util.sql and styles_themes_maps.dmp 
are available in ndm_tutotial\examples\data\ndmdemo directory and 
ndmtraffic.jar is available in ndm_tutorial\examples\java\lib directory.

Steps :
-------
(i) Login as sysdba.
(ii) Run ndmdemo.sql

(2)Creation and set up of navteq_sf user
----------------------------------------
Requirements:
-------------
	setup.sql 
         	SQL script that creates and sets up the user navteq_sf.
	NAVTEQ_SF_Sample.dmp
         	Dmp file for navteq_sf network data.
	demo.sql 
        	SQL script that sets up network data and traffic user data for demo.  
	setup_traffic_data.sql
       		SQL script that creates traffic user data.

Before running the scripts, make sure that the files mentioned above 
are in the same directory as the scripts setup.sql and demo.sql and 
scripts are run from this directory.
setup.sql, demo.sql and setup_traffic_data.sql are available in 
ndm_tutorial\examples\data\navteq_sf directory.

Steps :
-------
(i)   Login as sysdba.
(ii)  Run setup.sql
(iii) Connect as sysdba;
(iii) Run demo.sql 
*** Make sure that the user ndmdemo has been created before running demo.sql ***

Setting up web application components :
---------------------------------------
(1)Deploy  ndmdemo.ear 
     ndmdemo.ear file has the NDM demo web application component.
(2) Deploy mapviewer.ear 
(3) Configure mapviewer
     (i)    Log in as admin.
     (ii)   Create the data source ndmdemo (NDM demo user)
    (iii)   Create data source navteq_sf  (network  user)
(4) Deploy geocoder.ear
(5) Add the data source  navteq_sf (network user) to geocoder configuration file.

Running the demo :
------------------
(1) Open the ndmdemo webpage 
(2) Set the Mapviewer, Geocoder and database connection parameters using    
    getConfiguration.jsp (first item  on the demo menu).
