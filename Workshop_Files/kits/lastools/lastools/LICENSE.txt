  If you want to use LAStools commercially please contact me for licensing
  terms. A simple rule of thumb: if you have paid, for example, for ArcGIS
  from ESRI, the QT Modeler from Applied Imagery, LP360 from QCoherent, or
  similar products then you should also get a LAStools license. You can

  (a) license the existing executables for production
  (b) license the source code and adapt it for your own production needs
  (c) license the source code to include in your own software package
 
  Optionally you can also hire me as a consultant to either create tools
  tailored to your particular needs or to integrate the source code into
  your own software tools.
