Installing MapViewer in Glassfish server
========================================

Version: 2.0

Requirements
------------

You need a running Java 1.6 installation

Those instructions are for GlassFish version 3.1.


Installing glassfish
--------------------

1) Download glassfish from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/downloads/ogs-3-1-1-downloads-439803.html

ogs-3.1.1.zip (86MB) is the basic, platform-independant kit.

2) Unzip ogs-3.1.1.zip into a directory called  "ogs".

This will create a directory structure like this:

  .../ogs
      /glassfish3
        /bin
        /glassfish
          /bin
          /domains
          /lib
          ...
        ...
        /oracle-jdbc-drivers

3) Setup the JDBC driver

The default configuration does not include any Oracle JDBC driver. The driver is however included with the installation. All you need is to copy the driver into the "lib" directory:

  copy glassfish3\oracle-jdbc-drivers\ojdbc6.jar glassfish3\glassfish\lib

4) Start the default glassfish domain

The default installation comes with a pre-configured domain called "domain1". Start it using the "asadmin" command:

  glassfish3\bin\asadmin start-domain

5) Create an administration account for MapViewer

  glassfish3\bin\asadmin create-file-user --groups asadmin --authrealmname file mapadmin

You will be prompted for the password of the new "mapadmin" user (entered twice)

  Enter the user password> *********
  Enter the user password again> *********
  Command create-file-user executed successfully.

Note: by default, GlassFish's admin account is installed without any password. If you modified that account to use a password, then you will also be prompted for that password:

  Enter admin password for user "admin">

You can also create the user via the admin console:

- start the console:  http://localhost:4848/
- log in if requested (if you set a password for the admin userr)
- expand the "Configurations" item in the "Common tasks" menu, then "server-config", then "Security", then "Realms", then on the "file" realm (or go directly to http://localhost:4848/common/security/realms/realmEdit.jsf?name=file&configName=server-config)
- click the "Manage Users" button
- click "New"
- fill the form with:
  User ID = mapadmin
  Group List= asadmin
  New Password = the password for the mapadmin account
- click "OK"


Installing MapViewer
--------------------

1) Fixup the MapViewer kit

The current MapViewer kit (Version 11g ps4 (11.1.1.5.1)) does not contain the deployment descriptor for Glassfish that maps MapViewr's administrative role (map_admin_role) to Glassfish's administrative group (asadmin). This prevents access to any administrative functions of MapViewer (changing configuration parameters, managing map caches, etc).

To enable this, you need to perform the following:
- decompress the ear file (mapviewer.ear)
- decompress the war file (web.war)
- add file glassfish-web.xml to the WEB-INF directory
- recompress the war file
- recompress the ear file

Here is the content of glassfish-web.xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE glassfish-web-app PUBLIC "-//GlassFish.org//DTD GlassFish Application Server 3.1 Servlet 3.0//EN" "http://glassfish.org/dtds/glassfish-web-app_3_0-1.dtd">
<glassfish-web-app error-url="">
  <context-root>/mapviewer</context-root>
  <security-role-mapping>
    <role-name>map_admin_role</role-name>
    <group-name>asadmin</group-name>
  </security-role-mapping>
  <class-loader delegate="true"/>
  <jsp-config>
    <property name="keepgenerated" value="true">
      <description>Keep a copy of the generated servlet class' java code.</description>
    </property>
  </jsp-config>
</glassfish-web-app>


2) Deploy MapViewer

You can do this automatically, via the asadmin tool, or using the Glassfish console.

- Automatically:

Copy the mapviewer.ear file into the "autodeploy" directory of the default domain:

  copy mapviewer.ear glassfish3\glassfish\domains\domain1\autodeploy

The glasfish server will automatically deploy the application. If it is not running, it will deploy the application at the next restart.

- Using the command line administration tool

  glassfish3\bin\asadmin deploy mapviewer.ear

  (if necessary, you will be prompted for the password of the "admin" user)

- Using the admin console:

  - start the console:  http://localhost:4848/
  - log in if requested
  - click the "Applications" item in the "Common tasks" menu (or go directly to http://localhost:4848/common/applications/applications.jsf)
  - click on "Deploy"
  - browse to the mapviewer.ear file
  - click "OK".

3) Manage mapviewer

Use the mapadmin user and its password to manage MapViewer.

WARNING: Deployment of applications on Glassfish 3.1.1 on Windows is very slow: it can take over 5 minutes. This is a known problem (http://java.net/jira/browse/GLASSFISH-17094) to be fixed in 3.1.2 and 3.2.
